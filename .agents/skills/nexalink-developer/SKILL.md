# NexaLink System Overview & Autonomous Directives

Welcome, Jules! This document details the repository standards, system architecture, Supabase schema configurations, and verification routines for NexaLink, enabling you to work autonomously and asynchronously on this codebase.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Project Structure

NexaLink is a premium secure real-time communications application composed of:
1. **Python Backend Service (`/server`):** Built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and standard python library connections to Supabase.
2. **WebRTC Signalling Server (`/signalling`):** Managed via Node.js and Socket.IO.
3. **Vite + React Frontend Client (`/client`):** Powered by React, Lucide icons, and Vanilla CSS themes.

### Repository Map
- `client/` — Vite + React frontend client.
  - `src/App.tsx` — Main application logic, UI router, state variables, and WebRTC layout grid.
  - `src/index.css` — Global CSS styling tokens, scroll rules, and resizer styles.
  - `src/components/Whiteboard.tsx` — Dynamic collaborative whiteboard drawing canvas.
- `server/` — FastAPI Python backend server.
  - `main.py` — Core REST endpoints, auth verification, and CORS routing.
  - `db/supabase_api.py` — Database REST wrapper executing Supabase calls.
  - `db/models.py` — SQLAlchemy ORM schemas.
  - `db/session.py` — Database engine pooling and connection handles.
  - `db_optimize.py` — Migration script executing SQL and applying indexes.
- `infra/` — Shared infrastructure and migrations.
  - `migrations/supabase_schema.sql` — PostgreSQL database schemas, triggers, and RLS policies.

## 💾 Supabase Schema & Database Integration

NexaLink connects to a cloud-based Supabase PostgreSQL instance. All main tables use Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.

### Active Tables
1. **`public.user_profiles`** — Linked to Supabase Auth.
   - Schema: `id UUID`, `username VARCHAR(50)`, `email VARCHAR(100)`, `bio TEXT`, `profile_pic TEXT`.
   - Populated automatically upon sign-up via Postgres triggers.
2. **`public.rooms`** — Live room session catalog.
3. **`public.call_logs`** — Tracking active and historic joins/leaves.
4. **`public.direct_messages`** — 1-to-1 contacts persistent chat history.
5. **`public.direct_call_logs`** — Secure direct call records.
6. **`public.recording_consents`** & **`public.whiteboard_saves`** — Audit trails.

### Database Performance Indexes
High-speed indexes are applied to the following fields:
- `call_logs(username)` & `call_logs(room_id)`
- `meeting_summaries(room_name)`
- `recording_consents(room_name)`
- `direct_messages(conversation_key, sent_at DESC)`
- `direct_call_logs(conversation_key, started_at DESC)`

## 📋 Developer Directives for Jules

Jules, when you receive a task to improve or optimize the codebase, please adhere to these guidelines:

### 1. Database & Backend API Optimizations
- Keep all database credentials loaded safely from environment variables (`.env`).
- Ensure PostgREST parameters and query strings are URL-encoded (`urllib.parse.quote()`) before execution to prevent filter injection vulnerabilities.
- If editing SQLAlchemy ORM models, make sure any transaction poolers on port `6543` bypass client-side pools to prevent connection leaks (configure using `sqlalchemy.pool.NullPool`).

### 2. Client-Side Constraints (No `localStorage`)
- **NEVER** write or read session/state variables from standard local storage (`localStorage`).
- Always keep token, username, contacts list, current view, and notification indicators resident inside in-memory tab-scoped `sessionStorage` or backend endpoints.
- User profile data (`bio`, `profilePic`) must remain strictly database-driven: fetch from `/api/profile/{username}` on load, and push updates directly to `/api/profile/save` on modification.

### 3. Verification & Testing Routines
Before submitting a pull request, you MUST execute these standard verification commands:
- **Database Schema & Index Checks:**
  ```bash
  python server/db_optimize.py
  ```
  *(Verify that all public tables, triggers, and indices display a green checkout/report)*.
- **Client TypeScript Compile Validation:**
  ```bash
  cd client && npx tsc --noEmit
  ```
  *(Verify that type checking passes completely with zero errors)*.
- **Client Production Compilation Bundle:**
  ```bash
  cd client && npm run build
  ```
  *(Verify that the Vite build is successful and output chunks are compiled safely)*.

Please maintain this document's directives and always perform adversarial reviews of your own changes to ensure absolute code quality. Good luck!
